Hello, 
I'm Amir Ali,
and I started learning about computers and programming from the age of 11.
From the very beginning, my interest leaned towards web hacking,
phishing attacks, 
money laundering methods,
and fraud techniques.
Not because I thought they were cool or edgy,
but because I found them incredibly fascinating and calming. 
And right from the start, I found my best friend,
(Matin).
